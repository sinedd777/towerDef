# Cooperative Multiplayer Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

**Objective:** Transform the current competitive dual-map multiplayer into a cooperative single-map experience where two players work together using shared resources to defend against enemy waves.

**Key Changes:**
- Single shared 20x20 map (instead of dual maps)
- Turn-based placement system (eliminates concurrency issues)
- Shared resources (health, money, score)
- Automatic phase transitions
- Dual enemy spawn points with single exit point

**Target Timeline:** 4-6 weeks

## Current State vs Target State

| **Current Multiplayer** | **Target Cooperative** |
|---|---|
| 2 separate 20x20 maps at (-12.5,0,0) and (12.5,0,0) | 1 shared 20x20 map at (0,0,0) |
| Competitive gameplay | Cooperative gameplay |
| Individual player resources | Shared health (100), money ($150), score |
| Real-time placement with conflicts | Turn-based placement system |
| Complex UI synchronization | Simple turn indicators |
| Player-specific enemy spawning | Shared enemy defense with dual spawn points |

## Technical Architecture

### Game State Structure
```javascript
CooperativeGameState {
    // Shared resources
    sharedResources: {
        health: 100,
        money: 150, 
        score: 0,
        wave: 1
    },
    
    // Turn management
    gamePhase: 'building' | 'defense',
    currentTurn: 'player1' | 'player2',
    
    // Shape placement tracking
    shapesPlaced: {
        player1: 0,  // max 10
        player2: 0   // max 10
    },
    
    // Single shared board
    gameBoard: {
        mazePieces: Map(),
        towers: Map(),
        enemies: Map(),
        projectiles: Map()
    },
    
    // Dual spawn system
    spawnPoints: [
        {x: -8, z: -8, id: 'spawn1'},  // Northwest
        {x: -8, z: 8, id: 'spawn2'}    // Southwest
    ],
    exitPoint: {x: 8, z: 0}  // East center
}
```

### Game Flow
```
Phase 1: Building (20 turns total)
â”œâ”€â”€ Turn 1: Player1 places shape 1/10
â”œâ”€â”€ Turn 2: Player2 places shape 1/10
â”œâ”€â”€ Turn 3: Player1 places shape 2/10
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ Turn 19: Player1 places shape 10/10
â””â”€â”€ Turn 20: Player2 places shape 10/10 â†’ AUTO-START DEFENSE

Phase 2: Defense (unlimited turns)
â”œâ”€â”€ Turn 1: Player1 places/upgrades tower
â”œâ”€â”€ Turn 2: Player2 places/upgrades tower
â””â”€â”€ Continue while enemies spawn...

## Development Notes

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Turn-based over real-time:** Eliminates 80% of concurrency complexity
2. **Automatic phase transition:** No player coordination needed for phase changes
3. **No ghost modes:** Simple UI blocking instead of complex preview synchronization
4. **Shared everything:** Resources, map, objectives all shared between players
5. **Client-side validation:** Path validation happens client-side before server call

### Potential Challenges
1. **Dual spawn pathfinding:** Need to ensure at least one spawn point remains viable
2. **UI state management:** Keep turn indicators and blocking in sync
3. **Network edge cases:** Handle disconnections gracefully during turns
4. **Player balance:** Ensure both players contribute equally to strategy

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Spectator mode for additional players
- Turn timer for competitive play
- Replay system for reviewing strategies
- Multiple difficulty levels with different spawn/exit configurations
- Chat system for player coordination
