# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project now includes a complete maze-building phase with a working prototype that includes:
- Complete tower placement system
- Four distinct tower types
- Enemy spawning and pathfinding with A* algorithm
- Resource management system
- Wave progression
- Tetris-style maze building phase
- Dynamic pathfinding around player-placed obstacles

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented complete maze-building phase with Tetris shapes
2. Added dynamic pathfinding system using A* algorithm
3. Created dual-phase gameplay (Build Maze â†’ Defense)
4. Implemented drag-drop shape placement with rotation controls
5. Added comprehensive UI for maze building phase
6. Integrated obstacle-aware enemy pathfinding

## Active Decisions
1. Tower Balance
   - Tower costs range from $20 to $40
   - Damage values adjusted for better gameplay
   - Range values optimized for grid size

2. Enemy System
   - Regular spawning interval (2 seconds)
   - Wave progression every 10 kills
   - Health scaling with waves

3. UI/UX
   - Drag-and-drop tower placement
   - Clear visual feedback
   - Intuitive controls

## Current Considerations
1. Performance Optimization
   - Monitor FPS during heavy gameplay
   - Optimize object cleanup
   - Manage memory usage

2. Game Balance
   - Track tower effectiveness
   - Monitor resource economy
   - Assess difficulty progression

3. User Experience
   - Evaluate control responsiveness
   - Assess visual clarity
   - Monitor player feedback

## Elemental System Planning
1. Core Elements
   - Six base elements: Fire, Water, Nature, Light, Darkness, Earth
   - Element selection every 5 waves
   - Elemental boss spawning system

2. Tower Combinations
   - Single element towers (e.g., Fire Tower)
   - Dual element towers (e.g., Fire + Light = Lightning Tower)
   - Triple element possibilities for endgame
   - Element effectiveness system

3. Implementation Priority
   - Base element system and UI
   - Single element towers
   - Elemental boss mechanics
   - Dual element combinations
   - Triple element combinations

## Next Steps
1. Short Term
   - Implement base elemental system
   - Create elemental tower variants
   - Add elemental boss mechanics
   - Add sound effects
   - Implement particle effects
   - Add tower upgrades

2. Medium Term
   - Implement dual element combinations
   - Create more enemy types
   - Add special abilities
   - Implement save/load system

3. Long Term
   - Add triple element combinations
   - Add campaign mode
   - Create achievement system
   - Implement multiplayer support
