# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project has been successfully upgraded from basic geometric shapes to professional 3D models using the Kenney Tower Defense Kit. The game now features:
- Complete 3D asset integration with GLB model loading
- UFO enemy models with wave-based variations
- Modular tower system with base + weapon combinations
- Weapon-specific projectile models with proper orientation
- Environmental details (trees, rocks, crystals, spawn points)
- Enhanced lighting and visual effects
- Object pooling for performance optimization
- Particle system for explosions, impact effects, and death animations

## Recent Changes
1. **Asset Management System**: Created comprehensive AssetManager with GLTFLoader integration
2. **Loading Screen**: Added professional loading screen with progress tracking
3. **Enemy Models**: Replaced sphere geometries with UFO models (enemy-ufo-a/b/c/d.glb)
4. **Tower Models**: Implemented modular tower system using base + parts + weapons
5. **Projectile Models**: Added weapon-specific projectiles (bullets, arrows, cannonballs, boulders)
6. **Environment Enhancement**: Scattered environmental objects and added glowing spawn points
7. **Lighting Optimization**: Multi-light setup with enhanced shadows and tone mapping
8. **Performance Optimization**: Object pooling system for projectiles
9. **Visual Effects**: Particle system with explosions, sparks, and death effects

## Active Decisions
1. Tower Balance
   - Tower costs range from $20 to $40
   - Damage values adjusted for better gameplay
   - Range values optimized for grid size

2. Enemy System
   - Regular spawning interval (2 seconds)
   - Wave progression every 10 kills
   - Health scaling with waves

3. UI/UX
   - Drag-and-drop tower placement
   - Clear visual feedback
   - Intuitive controls

## Current Considerations
1. Performance Optimization
   - Monitor FPS during heavy gameplay
   - Optimize object cleanup
   - Manage memory usage

2. Game Balance
   - Track tower effectiveness
   - Monitor resource economy
   - Assess difficulty progression

3. User Experience
   - Evaluate control responsiveness
   - Assess visual clarity
   - Monitor player feedback

## Elemental System Planning
1. Core Elements
   - Six base elements: Fire, Water, Nature, Light, Darkness, Earth
   - Element selection every 5 waves
   - Elemental boss spawning system

2. Tower Combinations
   - Single element towers (e.g., Fire Tower)
   - Dual element towers (e.g., Fire + Light = Lightning Tower)
   - Triple element possibilities for endgame
   - Element effectiveness system

3. Implementation Priority
   - Base element system and UI
   - Single element towers
   - Elemental boss mechanics
   - Dual element combinations
   - Triple element combinations

## Next Steps
1. Short Term
   - Implement base elemental system
   - Create elemental tower variants
   - Add elemental boss mechanics
   - Add sound effects
   - Implement particle effects
   - Add tower upgrades

2. Medium Term
   - Implement dual element combinations
   - Create more enemy types
   - Add special abilities
   - Implement save/load system

3. Long Term
   - Add triple element combinations
   - Add campaign mode
   - Create achievement system
   - Implement multiplayer support
