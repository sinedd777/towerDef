- **Code Comments**: Well-documented classes and methods
- **Memory Bank**: Complete architectural and design documentation
- **Project Structure**: Clear file organization with purpose explanations

## Immediate Next Steps (If Continuing Development)

### 🔧 Ready for Extensions
The codebase is designed for easy extension. Priority areas for enhancement:

1. **Multiple Tower Types** (Ready to implement)
   ```javascript
   // Example: Sniper Tower
   class SniperTower extends Tower {
       constructor(x, y, z) {
           super(x, y, z);
           this.range = 6.0;    // Longer range
           this.fireRate = 0.3; // Slower fire rate
           this.damage = 150;   // Higher damage
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Enemy Varieties** (Framework in place)
   ```javascript
   // Example: Fast Enemy
   class FastEnemy extends Enemy {
       constructor(waypoints) {
           super(waypoints);
           this.speed = 2.0;   // Double speed
           this.health = 50;   // Half health
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Audio Integration** (Web Audio API ready)
   - Shooting sound effects
   - Enemy destruction sounds
   - Background music system
   - Volume controls in UI

### 🎨 Visual Enhancements (Low Priority)
- Particle effects for explosions
- Animated enemy death sequences
- Tower upgrade visual indicators
- Path effect animations

### 🕹️ Gameplay Features (Medium Priority)
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Boss enemies with special abilities
- Power-ups and special weapons
- Achievement system
- High score persistence

## Recent Decisions & Context

### ✅ Technology Choices Made
- **Vite over Webpack**: Faster development and simpler configuration
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework overhead, maximum performance
- **Three.js**: Industry standard for WebGL, excellent documentation
- **Fixed Camera**: Optimal for tower defense gameplay
- **Grid-based Placement**: Simplifies collision and positioning logic

### ✅ Architecture Patterns Applied
- **Component Entity System**: Each game object is self-contained
- **Observer Pattern**: GameState automatically updates UI
- **Factory Pattern**: Consistent object creation
- **Module System**: ES6 imports for clean dependencies

### ✅ Performance Optimizations Implemented
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Dead entities removed immediately
- **Efficient Collision**: Simple sphere-sphere distance checks
- **Fixed Timestep**: Consistent physics regardless of frame rate
- **Minimal Geometry**: Simple shapes for optimal rendering

const GAME_BALANCE = {
    TOWER_COST: 20,           // Money required per tower
    ENEMY_REWARD: 10,         // Money earned per kill
    ENEMY_SCORE: 100,         // Points per enemy destroyed
    TOWER_DAMAGE: 50,         // Damage per projectile hit
    ENEMY_HEALTH: 100,        // Starting enemy health
    TOWER_RANGE: 3.0,         // Tower detection radius
    ENEMY_SPAWN_RATE: 2000,   // Milliseconds between spawns
    WAVE_PROGRESSION: 10      // Enemies per wave advancement
};
```
