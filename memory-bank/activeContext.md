# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project has evolved from a single-player tower defense game into a comprehensive multiplayer system. We've successfully completed the **server infrastructure** and are now ready to implement the **multiplayer UI** based on the architectural designs in multiplayer.md and multiplayer-ui.md. The game now features:
- Complete 3D asset integration with GLB model loading
- UFO enemy models with wave-based variations
- Modular tower system with base + weapon combinations
- Weapon-specific projectile models with proper orientation
- Environmental details (trees, rocks, crystals, spawn points)
- Enhanced lighting and visual effects
- Object pooling for performance optimization
- Particle system for explosions, impact effects, and death animations
- Advanced curved pathfinding with Catmull-Rom splines
- Radius-aware collision detection maintaining 0.5 unit clearance
- Adaptive speed control based on path curvature

## Recent Changes
### Single-Player Foundation (Completed)
1. **Asset Management System**: Created comprehensive AssetManager with GLTFLoader integration
2. **Loading Screen**: Added professional loading screen with progress tracking
3. **Enemy Models**: Replaced sphere geometries with UFO models (enemy-ufo-a/b/c/d.glb)
4. **Tower Models**: Implemented modular tower system using base + parts + weapons
5. **Projectile Models**: Added weapon-specific projectiles (bullets, arrows, cannonballs, boulders)
6. **Environment Enhancement**: Scattered environmental objects and added glowing spawn points
7. **Lighting Optimization**: Multi-light setup with enhanced shadows and tone mapping
8. **Performance Optimization**: Object pooling system for projectiles
9. **Visual Effects**: Particle system with explosions, sparks, and death effects
10. **Playing Card UI**: Implemented sophisticated Tetris shape playing card interface with 3D stack effects, corner indicators, center shape display, hover instructions panel, and smooth card flip animations
11. **Enhanced Pathfinding**: Complete pathfinding rewrite with 0.25 unit grid resolution, Catmull-Rom spline curves, radius-aware collision detection, and adaptive speed control

### Multiplayer Server Infrastructure (Just Completed)
12. **Server Architecture**: Built complete Node.js + Express + Socket.IO server following multiplayer.md specifications
13. **Game Session Management**: Implemented GameSession class with full lifecycle management (waiting → ready → active → ended)
14. **Real-time Communication**: Created comprehensive event system for all multiplayer interactions
15. **Player Management**: Built PlayerHandler with connection tracking, stats, and profile management
16. **Game Logic Validation**: Implemented server-side validation for all game actions with anti-cheat measures
17. **Matchmaking System**: Created MatchmakingManager with queue management and compatibility matching
18. **State Synchronization**: Built delta-based state updates with 60 ticks/second game loop
19. **Monitoring & Logging**: Added comprehensive logging, health checks, and metrics endpoints
20. **Session Cleanup**: Implemented automatic cleanup of inactive sessions and connections

## Active Decisions
1. Tower Balance
   - Tower costs range from $20 to $40
   - Damage values adjusted for better gameplay
   - Range values optimized for grid size

2. Enemy System
   - Regular spawning interval (2 seconds)
   - Wave progression every 10 kills
   - Health scaling with waves
   - Curved movement with speed adaptation (50%-120% range)
   - 0.5 unit clearance from all boundaries and obstacles

3. UI/UX
   - Drag-and-drop tower placement
   - Clear visual feedback
   - Intuitive controls
   - Enhanced debug information showing curve data

## Current Considerations
1. Performance Optimization
   - Monitor FPS during heavy gameplay
   - Optimize object cleanup
   - Manage memory usage

2. Game Balance
   - Track tower effectiveness
   - Monitor resource economy
   - Assess difficulty progression

3. User Experience
   - Evaluate control responsiveness
   - Assess visual clarity
   - Monitor player feedback

## Elemental System Planning
1. Core Elements
   - Six base elements: Fire, Water, Nature, Light, Darkness, Earth
   - Element selection every 5 waves
   - Elemental boss spawning system

2. Tower Combinations
   - Single element towers (e.g., Fire Tower)
   - Dual element towers (e.g., Fire + Light = Lightning Tower)
   - Triple element possibilities for endgame
   - Element effectiveness system

3. Implementation Priority
   - Base element system and UI
   - Single element towers
   - Elemental boss mechanics
   - Dual element combinations
   - Triple element combinations

## Next Steps - Multiplayer UI Implementation
1. **Immediate Priority (Next Agent Tasks)**
   - Create NetworkManager class for Socket.IO client integration
   - Implement MultiplayerScene with dual 20x20 map layout (Player 1: center(-12.5,0,0), Player 2: center(12.5,0,0))
   - Build unified status bar showing both players' health/money/score/wave
   - Create private control panels for each player (maze builder + tower selection)
   - Implement MultiplayerInputManager with player-specific boundaries
   - Add connection status indicators and error handling

2. **Client-Server Integration**
   - Connect existing single-player systems to server events
   - Implement real-time state synchronization
   - Add spectator mode support
   - Create session join/create/leave workflows
   - Build matchmaking UI integration

3. **Advanced Multiplayer Features**
   - Add reconnection handling
   - Implement lag compensation
   - Create replay system foundation
   - Add tournament/ranking preparation
   - Performance optimization for dual-map rendering

## Server Implementation Status ✅
**COMPLETED**: Full multiplayer server infrastructure is ready and functional.

### What's Working
- Node.js + Express + Socket.IO server running on port 4000
- Complete GameSession lifecycle management (waiting → ready → active → ended)
- Real-time 60 FPS game loop with delta-based state synchronization
- Comprehensive event system for all multiplayer interactions
- Server-side validation and anti-cheat measures

- Health monitoring and metrics endpoints

### Key Files Created
- `server/index.js` - Main server entry point
- `server/game/GameSession.js` - Session management
- `server/game/GameState.js` - Authoritative game state
- `server/game/GameLogic.js` - Action validation
- `server/handlers/SessionHandler.js` - Session events
- `server/handlers/PlayerHandler.js` - Player management
- `server/handlers/GameEventHandler.js` - Game events
- `server/managers/MatchmakingManager.js` - Matchmaking
- `server/monitoring/Logger.js` - Logging system

### For Next Agent
1. **Start Here**: Read `memory-bank/server-implementation.md` for complete technical details
2. **Test Server**: Run `npm run server` to start the multiplayer server on localhost:4000
3. **Focus On**: Implementing the client-side multiplayer UI as specified in `memory-bank/multiplayer-ui.md`
4. **Architecture**: Follow dual-map layout with Socket.IO integration

The server is waiting for client connections on localhost:4000. All multiplayer infrastructure is complete and ready for UI integration.
