# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in active development with a working prototype that includes:
- Complete tower placement system
- Four distinct tower types
- Enemy spawning and pathfinding
- Resource management system
- Wave progression

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented tower destruction functionality
2. Added visual feedback for tower placement
3. Balanced tower costs and damage values
4. Improved enemy spawning system
5. Enhanced visual effects for tower attacks

## Active Decisions
1. Tower Balance
   - Tower costs range from $20 to $40
   - Damage values adjusted for better gameplay
   - Range values optimized for grid size

2. Enemy System
   - Regular spawning interval (2 seconds)
   - Wave progression every 10 kills
   - Health scaling with waves

3. UI/UX
   - Drag-and-drop tower placement
   - Clear visual feedback
   - Intuitive controls

## Current Considerations
1. Performance Optimization
   - Monitor FPS during heavy gameplay
   - Optimize object cleanup
   - Manage memory usage

2. Game Balance
   - Track tower effectiveness
   - Monitor resource economy
   - Assess difficulty progression

3. User Experience
