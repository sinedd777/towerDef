# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in active development with a working prototype that includes:
- Complete tower placement system
- Four distinct tower types
- Enemy spawning and pathfinding
- Resource management system
- Wave progression

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented tower destruction functionality
2. Added visual feedback for tower placement
3. Balanced tower costs and damage values
4. Improved enemy spawning system
5. Enhanced visual effects for tower attacks

## Active Decisions
1. Tower Balance
   - Tower costs range from $20 to $40
   - Damage values adjusted for better gameplay
   - Range values optimized for grid size

2. Enemy System
   - Regular spawning interval (2 seconds)
   - Wave progression every 10 kills
   - Health scaling with waves

3. UI/UX
   - Drag-and-drop tower placement
   - Clear visual feedback
   - Intuitive controls

## Current Considerations
1. Performance Optimization
   - Monitor FPS during heavy gameplay
   - Optimize object cleanup
   - Manage memory usage

2. Game Balance
   - Track tower effectiveness
   - Monitor resource economy
   - Assess difficulty progression

3. User Experience
   - Evaluate control responsiveness
   - Assess visual clarity
   - Monitor player feedback

## Elemental System Planning
1. Core Elements
   - Six base elements: Fire, Water, Nature, Light, Darkness, Earth
   - Element selection every 5 waves
   - Elemental boss spawning system

2. Tower Combinations
   - Single element towers (e.g., Fire Tower)
   - Dual element towers (e.g., Fire + Light = Lightning Tower)
   - Triple element possibilities for endgame
   - Element effectiveness system

3. Implementation Priority
   - Base element system and UI
   - Single element towers
   - Elemental boss mechanics
   - Dual element combinations
   - Triple element combinations

## Next Steps
1. Short Term
   - Implement base elemental system
   - Create elemental tower variants
   - Add elemental boss mechanics
   - Add sound effects
   - Implement particle effects
   - Add tower upgrades

2. Medium Term
   - Implement dual element combinations
   - Create more enemy types
   - Add special abilities
   - Implement save/load system

3. Long Term
   - Add triple element combinations
   - Add campaign mode
   - Create achievement system
   - Implement multiplayer support
