# Multiplayer Synchronization Strategy

## Overview
The multiplayer system in our tower defense game follows a "synchronized challenges, independent solutions" approach. Each player plays their own game while being able to spectate their opponent's game in real-time.

## Core Principles

### 1. Game Layout
- **Player's Game**: Left side of screen, fully interactive
- **Opponent's Game**: Right side of screen, spectator view only
- **Visual Distinction**: Different colors/indicators for each player's area

### 2. Synchronized Elements
These elements are identical for both players:

- **Wave Timing**
  - Wave start/end times
  - Enemy spawn intervals within waves
  - Total wave duration

- **Enemy Properties**
  - Types of enemies in each wave
  - Spawn order
  - Enemy attributes (health, speed, etc.)
  - Resources/rewards per kill

- **Game Rules**
  - Starting resources
  - Health system
  - Scoring system
  - Wave progression rules

### 3. Independent Elements
These elements are unique to each player:

- **Maze Construction**
  - Player-built maze layout
  - Path finding through the maze
  - Tower placement and upgrades
  - Strategic decisions

- **Game State**
  - Current health
  - Resources
  - Score
  - Tower configurations

## Network Optimization

### Priority Levels

1. **High Priority (Immediate Sync)**
   - Maze piece placements
   - Tower placements/upgrades/removals
   - Player health/score/resources
   - Wave start/end events

2. **Medium Priority (200ms interval)**
   - Enemy spawn events
   - Tower targeting/shooting events

3. **Low Priority (300-500ms interval)**
   - Enemy position updates
   - Projectile positions (optional)

### Bandwidth Optimization

1. **Delta Compression**
   - Only send state changes
   - Use previous state as reference
   - Compress repeated data

2. **State Batching**
   - Group multiple updates
   - Prioritize by importance
   - Optimize packet size

3. **Movement Prediction**
   - Client-side path following
   - Position interpolation
   - Local collision detection

## Wave Synchronization

### Server Responsibilities
1. Generate identical wave data for both players
2. Broadcast synchronized spawn signals
3. Manage wave progression
4. Track player performance

### Wave Data Structure
```javascript
{
  waveNumber: number,
  enemies: [
    {
      type: string,
      spawnTime: number,
      attributes: {
        health: number,
        speed: number,
        // other attributes
      }
    }
    // ... more enemies
  ],
  rewards: {
    completion: number,
    perKill: number
  }
}
```

### Client Responsibilities
1. Receive and process wave data
2. Spawn enemies on signal
3. Handle local path finding
4. Report performance metrics

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Network Manager
- Handle all network communications
- Manage state synchronization
- Process wave data
- Handle reconnection

### 2. Game State Manager
- Track local game state
- Apply network updates
- Manage wave progression
- Handle scoring

### 3. Renderer
- Render player's game
- Render opponent's game
- Handle visual effects
- Manage UI updates

## Testing Considerations

1. **Network Conditions**
   - Test with various latencies
   - Handle packet loss
   - Manage reconnections

2. **Game State**
   - Verify wave synchronization
   - Check enemy behavior
   - Validate scoring

3. **Performance**
   - Monitor bandwidth usage
   - Track frame rates
   - Measure state update times

## Success Metrics

1. **Network Performance**
   - Average bandwidth < 50KB/s
   - Latency tolerance up to 200ms
   - Smooth gameplay at 60fps

2. **Game Experience**
   - Synchronized wave starts
   - Consistent enemy behavior
   - Responsive controls

3. **Spectator View**
   - Real-time opponent updates
   - Clear visual feedback
   - Minimal visual artifacts
